*Blog #1*- Benthic! Genera! Subsetting! Phanerozoic!

And now I would like to say a few words. Here they are: Benthic! Genera! Subsetting! Phanerozoic!

A couple of weeks ago, if someone said this to me, I would’ve looked at them with a face that showed my obvious confusion. But being where I am now, I actually understand what these terms are- and I find that amazing. In the couple of weeks I have been in this program, I’ve already learned so much and I’ve experienced so many new things. 

For example, I had never coded anything before using R with all the other Biodiversity interns. It was completely new to me. And now that I’ve tried it, I’m glad. It was daunting to try something difficult and foreign, but now it feels good to understand certain parts that were harder in the beginning. 

Similarly, reading scientific papers and looking at fossils up-close were new experiences that I’m glad to have. It’s like I’m stepping into the shoes of a paleontologist everytime I enter the classroom. Not only have I acquired new skills, but I’ve been able to really strengthen what I know about science through these new skills.


Some of my favorite parts of this program so far have been the field trip to New Brighton State Beach and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, learning about the different phyla/ taxonomic classifications, and being able to talk to other interns from different groups on Thursdays. I’m also really looking forward to the overnight trip where we go to Pinnacles. The entire program is made so that it’s really engaging and interactive, which is really cool.

All in all, I’ve had a great first couple of weeks here, and I’m looking forward to the rest of the program!
