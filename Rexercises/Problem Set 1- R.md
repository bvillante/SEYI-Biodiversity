**Problem Set 1:**

1. Data frame- by entering class(mtcars)
2. It's a vector because when I entered dim(precip) the result was NULL, so it has no dimensions, and therefore can't be an array ?
3. By entering as.matrix(trees)
4. Atlanta- precip[14]
5. By entering c(mtcars, precip, trees)
6. Yes, by entering precip
7. mtcars[2,7] mtcars[ ,qsec] [2]
