**Problem Set 1:**

1. Data frame- by entering class(mtcars)
2. It's a vector because when I entered dim(precip) the result was NULL, so it has no dimensions, and therefore can't be an array ?
3. By entering as.matrix(trees)
4. Atlanta- precip[14]
5. By entering c(mtcars, precip, trees)
6. Yes, by entering precip
7. mtcars[2,7] , mtcars[ ,"qsec"] [2] , mtcars[2, "qsec"] , mtcars["Mazda RX4 Wag", ] [7]
8. precip[("Juneau", "Phoenix", "Sacramento")]<- c(23, 46, 12)
9. "Girth">"Volume = FALSE
10. A<-sum(trees[ ,Height])  ||| B<-sum(mtcars["Valiant", ])  ||| C<-sum(precip[1:8]) ||| C/B +A
